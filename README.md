# This is an Android App named Firebase_demo which is connected to firebase realtime database in which we can add information upto 10 gb of data in the database. Here the **ID** will be allocated automatically and auto incremnet is enabled for the app. The database is only accessed by the admin and u can only use the app for connectivity and popup will show the toast widget on the app. This was my first attempt to connect database to an android app.It was suceessfully done!
